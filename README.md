## The Objective

To create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected (special, numeric, uppercase or lowercase characters).

## The Motive
To randomly generate a strong password that meets certain criteria to provide the user with greater security.

## The Solution
Used javascript to create a series of prompts, confirms, alerts, functions and loops that prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password. Their password must be a minimum of 8 characters and cannot have more than 128 characters. Based on what criteria the user selects a random password will be generated.
